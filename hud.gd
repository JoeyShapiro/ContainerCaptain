# list of packed scenes

# seems best most pratical way
# menu items call parent with item
# use functions
# parent emits
# hud emits
# main catches

# x each menu item has an emit caught by parent/main
# cant be dynamic

# x menu items call root function
# bad practice

# x everyone keeps emitting and pass it up
# to much flow control
# either way items store and send scene

# drones stop moving if no pay

# scale game with scale of window

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
